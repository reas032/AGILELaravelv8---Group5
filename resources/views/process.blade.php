      <h3>Processes Involved in Agile Development Methodology</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
      1. User Story Prioritization<br><br>
      User stories or features are the functional requirements of the software under development. 
      Before moving on with implementing the Agile Development methodology, 
      the teams need to prioritize the user stories based on:<br><br>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Must-Have Features:</b> These are the features that are essential for the software </li>
        <li><b>Nice-to-Have-Features:</b> These are the features that can be worked upon later after the MVP is launched</li>
      </ul>

      </p>

        <br>
      <p>
      2. Daily Standups/Daily Scrum<br><br>
      These are meetings that are conducted daily to measure the team’s progress 
      while ensuring accountability.<br><br>
      Daily standups are essential for identifying the team’s problems, 
      backlog grooming for planning for the coming sprints, the progress, 
      and the team’s morale to — ensure that the Agile team is on the same page. 
      At the same time, it maintains a sustainable pace for development.

      </p>

      <br>
      <p>
      3. Retrospectives<br><br>
These are activities that involve putting past experiences at the forefront. 
All the learnings are discussed so that the next sprint cycles or projects do not repeat past mistakes. 
It is all about learning from mistakes and finding better and foolproof ways to deliver the software.

      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
      4. Sprints<br><br>
    Sprint cycles are a prominent part of the Agile Development methodology process. 
    Here the prioritized user stories are divided into time-boxed sprints 
    — weekly or monthly cycles at the end of which the completed user stories need to be delivered.

    </p>

    <br>
    
      <p>
      5. INVEST<br><br>
        This is an activity to ensure the quality of the completed user story. INVEST stands for:<br><br>

        <ul>
        <li><b>Independent</b> — The user story should be independent and loosely coupled with the other user stories</li>
        <li><b>Negotiable</b> — The user stories should be open for reviews. 
        The team should be able to modify and delete the user stories based on the changing requirements. </li>
        <li><b>Valuable</b> — The individual user story should offer value to the client and the end-user</li>
        <li><b>Estimable</b> — Agile estimation should be feasible, i.e., the user story size and its future scope should be estimable</li>
        <li><b>Small</b> — The user story size should be small enough to be achieved in a few days or weeks. 
        When the user stories get extended over that period, the user stories are referred to as epics, which, in turn, 
        need to be broken down into smaller segments that can be achieved conveniently by the Agile teams.</li>
        <li><b>Testable</b> — The user story should be independently workable and testable</li>
        </ul>
